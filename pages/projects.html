                        Dinocord is a Discord library that I made for fun and to challange myself. It is not meant to be used by someone who is serious with their Discord bot, but by someone who wants to try new things and leave constructive critizism.

                        Due to me having to many mods, I decided to make a page for them. You can find it <a href="./BeatSaber/mods.html">here</a>, or at clicking the title above.
