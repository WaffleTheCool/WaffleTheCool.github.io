                        Adblock is a mod that blocks very distracting, soundpack promotion button in the main menu of Beat Saber. It was an easy mod to make just using a single file with mostly boilerplate code with a single hook I made.

                        AniPic is a modification of an older version of the mod Nya-Quest (<a href="https://github.com/FrozenAlex/Nya-quest">repo, newest version</a>). AniPic brought you pictures from an API called <a href="https://some-random-api.ml/endpoints">some-random-api.ml</a> and displayed them in the main menu. It was a fun mod to make, but I decided to stop working on it as it was a pain to update.

                        FeetSaber is a mod that allows you to play Beat Saber with your feet. It was a fun mod to update but as I am <strike>half lazy</strike> still a newbie (and modding is a bitch) I have decided to stop supporting it for now.
